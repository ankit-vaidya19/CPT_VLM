- This IS expected if you are initializing LlavaLlamaForCausalLM from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LlavaLlamaForCausalLM from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

It will be removed in the future and UntypedStorage will be the only storage class. This should only matter to you if you are using storages directly.
